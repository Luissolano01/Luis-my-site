		<p>I am a student at UMSI pursuing a Bachelor of Science
			 in Information with a minor in entrepreneurship. Heavily interested in the UI/UX 
			 side of things, developing my programming skills has been an intriguing journey.
			  I enjoy learning about a
			  multitude of aspects such as technology, sustainable action, complex
			   issues within society, and other entrepreneurial endeavors including startups, marketing, 
			   and networking. With the help of mentors and programs, such as optiMize and Dare to Dream at ZLI, 
			   he has initiated his own project, Bamb√∫, that revolves around sustainability
			    and humanity due to the environmental and social pressure highlighted in the 
				year 2020. I have also had the opportunity to work as part of the core team for an accelerator
				 type startup known as Maximize, where I helped gather and synthesize 
				information for UI/UX processes to  help deliver a high quality user 
				experience. Besides business, I really enjoy spending time with my family and 
				friends. Being in nature is always fun for me.</p>
